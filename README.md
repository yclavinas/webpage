I’m a Ph.D. student, first year, at the University of Tsukuba. I am very excited about any topic related to Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation, neuro-evolution, and Artificial Life. My master’s research topic includes refining Resource Allocation on the fly on MOEA/D and Parameter Analysis, which I am currently expanding by analyzing a component-wise approach for Resource Allocation in MOEA/D in parallel.
