I’m a postdoc research working with histopathology image analysis for cancer treatment with genetic programming, at the University of Toulouse, France in the [IRIT@CRCT](https://www.crct-inserm.fr/iritcrct/) group. I got my PhD degree from the University of Tsukuba, Japan. My research interests are related to Computational Intelligence, such as Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life, especially Evolutionary Algorithms (EC), with a greater focus on multi-objective optimization and Cartesian GP. I’m engaged in cooperating in projects for using EC as a tool to solve problems in any field.

EC are heuristics based on ideas from biological evolution. The goal of EC is to learn solutions to challenging computational problems using ideas taken from the evolutionary process. EC can solve a few examples of problems: parameter optimization, product design, expert systems design, linear and non-linear regression, and automated control.

<!-- I am amazed that evolution works in programs and artificial constructs, and I think that the possibility of evolving fully virtual creatures is fascinating. I want to create complex virtual ecosystems and the creatures that inhabit it using the open-ended evolution of programs. -->
<!-- I'm am interested in programs that can adapt themselves, both applications (black box optimization, multi-agent systems, games), as well as more speculative use of these ideas (virtual creatures and their worlds). -->
