Currently, I'm a master student, second year, at the University of Tsukuba. I am very excited about any topic related to Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation, neuro-evolution for games and Data visualization. I'm exploring MOEA/D and Genetic Algorithms for some time now. My master research topic include refining Resource Allocation on the fly on MOEA/D and Parameter Analysis.
