I’m a PhD candidate, second year, at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. My research interests are related to Computational Intelligence, such as Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life, especially Evolutionary Algorithms (EC), with a recent focus on multi-objective optimization. I’m engaged in cooperating in projects for using EC as a tool to solve problems in any field.

EC are heuristics based on ideas from biological evolution. The goal of EC is to learn solutions to challenging computational problems using ideas taken from the evolutionary process. EC can solve a few examples of problems: parameter optimization, product design, expert systems design, linear and non-linear regression, and automated control.

Specialities: Genetic Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation, and Artificial Life.

<!-- ### MOEA/D and Partial Update of the Population -->

<!-- The Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) generally is considered a practical algorithm for solving MOPs. The key idea of the MOEA/D is to decompose the multiple objectives into a large number of single-objective subproblems and then to solve these subproblems in by a population-based evolutionary approach. It has since become clear that focusing computational effort on specific subsets of these subproblems can substantially improve the performance of MOEA/D, for which Resource Allocation techniques are used for consistently improve the performance of MOEA/D.  -->

<!-- 1. What is the optimal number of subproblems to receive resources and update? More importantly, how updating just a part of the population can improve the convergence speed of MOEA/D? -->
<!-- 1. What should be the criteria for allocating more computational effort on one problem or another? One based on convergence? Or diversity? Robustness?  -->
<!-- 2. What are the components of MOEA/D that show better synergy with the Resource Allocation techniques? Are they the decomposition techniques, the number of sub-problems the metric for choosing which sub-problems to update? What else? -->

<!-- #### Multi-Objective Real-world Problems with constraints -->

<!-- Finding good solutions for Multi-objective Problems (MOPs) is considered a hard problem, especially when considering MOPs with constraints. Thus, most of the works in the context of MOPs do not explore in-depth how different constraints affect the performance of MOP solvers. We focus on exploring the effects of different Constraint Handling Techniques (CHTs) on MOEA/D. Moreover, we introduce a simple and effective CHT focusing on the exploration of the decision space, the Three Stage Penalty. To further enhance the performance of MOEA/D, we propose an efficient CHT that works well with problems that require an exploration of the unfeasible search space. -->

<!-- Currently, we are expanding this work to finding ways to improve the performance of MOEA/D on simulated real-world problems using MOEA/D variants that use resource allocation since they show promising results in MOP without constraints. -->

<!-- ### Human-Computer Collaboration for the Generation of Soccer Strategies using Multi-Agent Simulations -->

<!-- How close is football (soccer) video games similar to real-life football matches? What real games can learn from video games? What video games can learn from real games? Which aspects do they share, and which they do not? Our group is focusing on answering these questions by comparing video games matches with data from real matches in Brazil. -->

<!-- Ongoing work refers to deepening our understanding regarding the different simulation variations, aiming to address the following research questions: -->

<!-- 1. How to "calibrate" simulated matches to properly handle sampling issues and interruptions? -->
<!-- 2. How do different simulations differ from each other? -->
<!-- 3. Which kinds of simulated games are more similar to professional games? -->
<!-- 4. Which types of simulated games better encode intrinsic tactical relationships (coordination) between teams? -->
