# About me

<div class="column-left">

Currently, I'm a PhD student, first year, at the University of Tsukuba. I am very excited about any topic related to Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation, neuro-evolution and Artificial Life. I'm exploring MOEA/D and Genetic Algorithms for some time. My master research topic include refining Resource Allocation on the fly on MOEA/D and Parameter Analysis.

## Summary of Research Projects

### MOEA/D and Resource Allocation

Multi objective optimization algorithms (MOP solvers) are hard problems, since finding the best solutions for multi-objective problems can be very computationally expensive. One common approach that MOP solvers use when trying to solve MOP is to decompose the MOP into many subproblems. In general, those MOP solvers give the same computational effort to them all. This has some drawbacks: (1) Some subproblems are harder than others, thus the MOP solver requires more computational effort to find better solutions; (2) The MOP solvers might waste computational effort improving solutions that require much effort to improve.

To minimize the effect of these drawbacks, I focus my research on: 1) minimizing computational effort on multi-objective optimization algorithms and 2) improving the performance of multi objective optimization algorithms (MOP solvers) by making them adapt to the characteristics of the problems. 

### Human-Computer Collaboration for the Generation of Soccer Strategies using Multi-AgentSimulations

How close are football (soccer) video games similar to real life football matches? What real games can learn from video games? What video games can learn from real games? Which aspects do they share and which they do not? Our group is focusing on answering these questions, by comparing video games matches with data from real matches in Brazil.

I graduated from the University of Brasilia (UnB) (2009-2016), where I studied Genetic Algorithm, focusing on generate Earthquake Risk Models. I did some volunteer work during my undergraduate time at UnB in a junior enterpriser called CJR. There I had the opportunity to work with web development and protect management. Then, I came to Japan, where I'm currently living, as a research student at the University of Tsukuba. After a 6 month period, I entered the master course at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. At the beginning of 2020, I concluded my Master's course in Computer Science at the University of Tsukuba. In April 2020, I start my PhD coursem at the University of Tsukuba.  My research interests include Evolutionary Computation and optimization as well as Neuroevolution, and their applications.

I already collaborate with the Department of Computer Science at the University of Brasilia and I'm looking foward to more!

Among non-research activities, I teach physics to brazilian highschool students.
